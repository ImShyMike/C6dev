# C6dev

A tiny and low power dev board for the ESP32-C6 with 10 GPIO pins, microSD card slot, 64Mbit (8MB) of Quad SPI Flash, USB C 2.0, a step-down converter for efficiency, 2.4 GHz ceramic chip antenna and very cool silkscreen. All pins are labeled with their number, actual GPIO and even other functions.

I've been wanting to make a devboard for a while now so i decided to make one with a RISC-V, low power MCU while breaking out a bunch of useful stuff while still keeping an acceptable amount of GPIO.

It was quite a lot harder than I expected with all the datasheet searching and looking up everything to make sure it works but atleast the routing was quite fun.
