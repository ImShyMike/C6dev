# July 26th: Started researching

Started looking for and reasearching a bunch of chips from Expressif and STMicroelectronics

Most interesting ones:

- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6
- STM32F407
- STM32F746

**Total time spent: 1h**

# July 26th pt2: Made a choice and started designing the schematic

I ended up choosing the ESP32-C6 for it's low power consumption, speed, relatively low complexity and availability

# July 26th pt3: More schematic making :sob:

Tried to actually use net labels propperly and follow best practices while keeping the schematic clean and already have a 5v to 3.3v step down, crystals, flash, usb c, boot/reset buttons and a microSD.

# July 26th pt4: Finishing up the schematic

Should be finished with the schematic will double check everything for errors and start the with the PCB
